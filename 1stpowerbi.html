										<h2 class="major">QUARTERLY BUSINESS PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW</h2>
                                        <p>A data‑driven look at Q1 performance across 459 public companies, highlighting market capitalization, sales distribution by cap‑tier, and standout industries driving value and growth.</p>

                                        
                                              <a href="#" class="image">
                                                <img src="images/1stPowerBi.png" alt="Quarterly Business Performance Dashboard" />
                                              </a>

                                              </section>
                                              <section id="footer">
                                                <div class="inner">
                                              
                                              <p>

  <p>In my latest analysis, I examined a diverse pool of <span class="highlight">459 companies</span>, representing a combined market capitalization of <span class="highlight">$13.25 million</span> and quarterly sales of <span class="highlight">$1.75 million</span>. This review aimed to uncover performance patterns across market capitalizations, companies, and sales outcomes.</p>

  <div class="divider"></div>

  <h2>Top Performers: Powerhouses of Growth</h2>
  <p>By evaluating the data, I identified:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The top 10 companies by quarterly sales, and</li>
    <li>The top 5 companies by market capitalization.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>What stood out was the overlap between market dominance and sales strength—<span class="highlight">Reliance Industries</span> and <span class="highlight">TCS</span> appeared on both lists. Their consistent performance reinforces their status as industry leaders with both strong fundamentals and market trust.</p>

  <div class="divider"></div>

  <h2>Sales Distribution: The Scale Advantage</h2>
  <p>An analysis of revenue contribution across capitalization tiers revealed:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><span class="highlight">Large-cap</span> companies led the charge, contributing a remarkable <span class="highlight">71.67%</span> of all quarterly sales ($1.25 million).</li>
    <li><span class="highlight">Mid-cap</span> companies followed, accounting for <span class="highlight">15.05%</span>.</li>
    <li><span class="highlight">Small-cap</span> and <span class="highlight">very small-cap</span> companies lagged, with <span class="highlight">8.46%</span> and <span class="highlight">4.82%</span>, respectively.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This concentration of sales within large-cap firms highlights the economic weight and stability these companies bring to the broader market.</p>

  <div class="divider"></div>

  <h2>Industry Leaders: Where the Money Flows</h2>
  <p>Though some data gaps limited our depth, clear industry trends emerged from our investigation.</p>

  <p><strong>Top Industries by Sales Last Quarter:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Oil & Gas</li>
    <li>Conglomerates (Oil, Retail, Telecom)</li>
    <li>Automotive</li>
    <li>Banking & Financial Services</li>
    <li>Gold & Jewelry</li>
    <li>Steel & Mining</li>
    <li>Information Technology (IT) Services</li>
    <li>Engineering & Construction</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Top Industries by Market Capitalization:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Conglomerates (Oil, Retail, Telecom)</li>
    <li>Information Technology (IT) Services</li>
    <li>Banking & Financial Services</li>
    <li>Conglomerates (FMCG, Hotels, Paper, Agri, etc.)</li>
    <li>Financial Services (Housing Finance)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>These overlapping sectors reveal a robust growth-consistency pattern— industries that lead in valuation also tend to drive revenue, cementing their strategic importance in the economy.</p>

  <div class="divider"></div>

  <h2>Outlier Insight: The Case of Bajaj Holdings</h2>
  <p>A particularly notable anomaly was <span class="highlight">Bajaj Holdings</span>, a company with a large market capitalization but surprisingly very low sales performance. Due to limited available data, we couldn’t pinpoint the exact cause. However, given its significant market presence, this is a deviation worth further exploration.</p>

  <div class="divider"></div>

  <h2>Conclusion: A Clear Market Pulse</h2>
  <p>Despite limited data in some segments, the direction is clear. The <span class="highlight">Information Technology</span>, <span class="highlight">Oil & Gas</span>, and <span class="highlight">Banking & Financial Services</span> sectors stand out as the most influential players, showing strong alignment between market confidence and revenue generation.</p>

  <p>These sectors are not just surviving—they’re leading. And in a fragmented market landscape, that leadership speaks volumes.</p>
